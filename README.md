## 🪴Hello World ~ ##

**Hi, I'm Loreli, a passionate problem-solver delving into the world of engineering and loving it!💃**

**Recently completed my Coder Academy Fullstack Web Development Program in July 2023 and currently bringing my background in application development and digital marketing to provide a unique perspective in the DevOps space. With a focus in the Observability practice, I am involved in integrating quality early in the development process - using visibility to drive critical insights across all levels.**
